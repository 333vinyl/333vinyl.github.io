&lt;p&gt;Drake is the best out there right now and I’ll go to bat for that statement. His influence on the current playing field is undeniable and unmatched, and while rappers like Kendrick Lamar may possess unmatched technical prowess and have stellar releases, no one in hip hop has Drake’s stopping power. A Drake co-sign can turn nobodies into stars (ILOVEMAKONNEN, Dej Loaf) or be the catalyst for cross-over (2 Chainz, A$AP Rocky, The Weeknd). So whether Drake’s new release is a ‘surprise album’ or a mixtape release preceded by &lt;a href="http://333vinyl.us/www.kanyetothe.com/forum/index.php?topic=2637065.0"&gt;calculated hints&lt;/a&gt;, the hip hop community suffered a collective heart attack when IYRTITL dropped.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Any speculation that IYRTITL is merely a ruse to eschew his Cash Money ties or classification as throwaway tracks from his upcoming release does nothing but magnify how impressive the quality of this project is. Aurally, Drake has taken the unique sound crafted by 40 and 1da in past releases and made it more muddled and darker where 2013’s &lt;em&gt;Nothing Was the Same was crisp&lt;/em&gt;. Songs like "Energy" sound—as Drake described himself—"evil" and where he once sounded triumphant, he is jaded and vicious. Drake finds success through delivery rather than lyrics more so than ever in IFYRITL, and besides his usual phenomenal ability to melodize almost anything, he has more punch yet it seems almost nonchalant. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Songs like “Know Yourself” and “10 Bands” could easily hold up to any other fan-favorites and “Legend”—while no competition to “Over My Dead Body”—is arguably his next best album-opener. “Used To” is even better than its appearance on &lt;em&gt;Sorry For the Wait 2&lt;/em&gt; without Wayne’s autotune plus a biting second Drake verse, and “Preach” has an outrageously stupid yet effective hook that hasn’t left me since I first heard it. However, the album begins to lose some luster with some of the last few tracks. “You &amp;amp; 6” is a touching song, but comes off as boring and ending almost all of his rhymes with ‘mama’ doesn’t do much but irritate. Additionally, “6PM in New York” is one Drake’s weakest straight-bars songs and I prefer to end a listen with the silky “Jungle”. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If IYRTITL was meant to hold fans over until Views From the 6 then it exceeded in all regards. It can be hold its ground against Drake’s best releases and surpassed all of Drake’s other mixtapes. IYRTITL is indicative of Drake’s growth—a great example of him "rapping like the throne should be the three of y’all."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;Used to be a hobby now it’s all I think about // That’s what rap does&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yung Lean is undeniably interesting. He first garnered attention with &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vrQWhFysPKY"&gt;"Ginseng Strip 2002"&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stgrSjynPKs"&gt;"Hurt"&lt;/a&gt;, and while he came off as a goofy swede adopting esoteric internet culture, he was-in the purest form-just a young hip-hop fan. He was an avid listener who, freed from any American preconceptions about rap and lucky enough to be around some incredibly musical producers, just went for it. It worked: they made a great project, established a ravenous fanbase, and garnered internet-wide attention. Lean clearly found his calling and realized he wanted to eschew any association with so-called "meme rap."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So he released &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMgkt9jdjTU"&gt;"Kyoto"&lt;/a&gt;, a song that caught doubters off-gaurd. To many, the song still seemed ridiculous, his rapping terrible, and the video over-the-top silly, but to those who had seen "Hurt" saw the metamorphosis. Unknown Memory is the product of this change, the creation of a Yung Lean who unexpectedly became a full-fledged rap star; complete with a sold-out tour.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Gone are many of the nonsensical lines and perpetual non-sequiturs. Yung Lean replaces them with confidence, introspective musings, and braggadocio that–while it was seen as comedic in past work–in many cases can now be assumed true. This is what a lot of the disappointment and negative reactions stem from. Making the switch from quasi-joke rapper to post quasi-joke rapper with more serious songs puts him in limbo–should be compared with traditional rappers? Or should he be lumped with the rappers who get a handicap for being a “meme”? Yung Lean is transitioning, what some could even posture as artistic growth. Shedding mumbling for an auto-tune drawl a la Future does him favors in furthering his confidence, and complements the production fantastically. And that is what Lean is all about, he is yet another instrument to the Yung Gud or the Yung Sherman band which backs him up. In tracks like “Yoshi City” and “Ghosttown” Lean seems most formidable, and these are easily the most “Kyoto”-esque in terms of accessibility. “Ice Cold Smoke” is the most auto-tuned, but with slow skittering hats, a short time stamp, and a fantastic beat switch, it is digestible. Lean succeeds again with infectious choruses–I catch myself singing “Don’t Go” and “Blinded” at various points during the day. However, in songs like “Sandman” and “Volt” the beats are overly busy, and Lean’s raps do not mesh. The instrumental tracks also did nothing but annoy me, and the only purpose I could see them serving would be to either provide a break from Lean’s voice or to jar the listener in preparation for his unorthodox sound. That being said, I liked a good amount of tracks on this album, thought it was a decent project overall, and I appreciate his development. There are a few tracks that will definitely go in rotation for the long term. The over-the-top nature of his previous project, Unknown Death, is lost in Unknown Memory and while it has positive implications, the album lacks some of that original charm by ironically being believable.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yung Lean has merit. If you don’t like the rapping or the production, at least appreciate the new concepts of hip-hop he has to bring the the table, the culture that he has appropriated and fashioned into a cult, or simply that he is doing his thing as an 18 year old non-native speaker. This cult of "sadboys" may be doing him no favors in the way that Lil B’s #taskforce annoys the hell out of casual listeners, but he is another interesting case of niche hip-hop and internet fame.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hi, I’m Sara and I will be contributing to 333vinyl. My taste includes the foundation of indie rock central to the site in addition to special detail to female vocalists and experimental alternative rock.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Depression is a strange thing. It influences your capacity to create, so creative people tend to go through periods of inactivity. With its terror comes a common ground that all people with depression can fall back upon. This foundation is exemplified in Rilo Kiley’s sophomore album, &lt;em&gt;The Execution of All Things&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Having loss and regret at the forefront of this album made it easy to connect to during one of my own episodes. The opening track, “The Good That Won’t Come Out”, tugs on the bottom of your coat until you’re forced to listen to what it has to say. Right away, vocalist Jenny Lewis attempts to make a connection with the listener: “let’s get together and talk about the modern age.” A desire to stray from stagnation makes its appearance through the album, along with Lewis and co-vocalist Blake Sennett’s personal experiences with depression.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;“You say I choose sadness, that it never once has chosen me. Maybe you’re right.” (“The Good That Won’t Come Out”)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Musically, &lt;em&gt;The Execution of All Things&lt;/em&gt; is of the standard indie pop rock fare that made its rounds in the early 2000s. It is less inspired by country rock compared to their previous efforts, more so matching the Omaha Sound referenced in the title track “The Execution of All Things”. After all, the record was released off of Saddle Creek Records, founded by Bright Eyes’ frontman Conor Oberst. However, &lt;em&gt;The Execution of All Things&lt;/em&gt; does continue down the established path of its predecessor by incorporating electronic sounds—not quite the MIDI-like interludes of &lt;em&gt;Take Offs and Landings&lt;/em&gt;, but like the introduction to the title track, an anticipatory build to the reflective prose within. Its frank delivery of lyrics is what makes the album truly unique and what increased their recognition in the scene with their next album, &lt;em&gt;More Adventurous&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, similar to the “Variations on a Theme” interludes from their first album, pieces of a song appear throughout the album after “So Long”, “My Slumbering Heart”, and “Spectacular Views”. This song delivered in three parts is named by its last lyric, “And That’s How I Choose to Remember It”. The song is an exposition on the divorce of Lewis’ parents and her childhood that perfectly strings together the album’s motifs and adds to its overall cohesiveness.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lewis was undoubtedly the face of the band (which broke up in 2011); however, there are still two tracks with vocals by Sennett on the album. The stronger of the two is “Three Hopeful Thoughts”, a hard rocking song about the removal of someone from one’s life. There are many goodbyes on this album: to parents, to lovers, to parts of one’s self. The kind of goodbye explored on this song is one that the author is in control of and actively wants, a contrast to the others present. This gives the song and subsequently the album a different kind of hope: a hope that acknowledges the pain of the past but also focuses on the opportunities of the future.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The stand-out track on an album filled with poignant insights is also its biggest hit, “A Better Son/Daughter”. It turns the themes of the album to max volume at the most important moment, guiding the listener through the portion of a depressive episode where one realizes they will have to fight and make it through the fog, reminding them that the good may be gone for now but it can still come out of them. &lt;em&gt;The Execution of All Things&lt;/em&gt; is an essential part of Rilo Kiley’s catalog and a quintessential indie-rock representation of grief.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is the best New Pornographers album since &lt;em&gt;Twin Cinema&lt;/em&gt;. The Canadian supergroup excels in celebratory music, and after two somewhat-lackluster offerings with a darker sound, &lt;em&gt;Brill Bruisers&lt;/em&gt; is a triumphant return. Frontman A.C. Newman described the record as "a celebration record," and the band follows through completely on that promise, boasting titles such as "Champions of Red Wine" and "Dancehall Domine."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The album begins with the title track, a single with a masterful ear-worm of a wordless chorus. Two lighter celebratory songs follow that sound like they could be from earlier New Pornographers albums, "Champions of Red Wine" and "Fantasy Fools."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Next comes my personal favorite track, "War on the East Coast." Its &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WMcumbSMY_8"&gt;brilliant 90s-Britpop-style video&lt;/a&gt; combined with Dan Bejar's unique vocal stylings make for four minutes of up-tempo bliss. It's one of those songs that feels like you've been waiting to hear for a long time. The song transitions smoothly into "Backstairs," which starts with slow, vocoder vocals but eventually breaks out into one of the band's grooviest verses. Neko Case's golden voice propels along the following "Marching Orders," which concludes one of the strongest trios the band has recorded. "Another Drug Deal of the Heart" serves as a quick, fun epilogue.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is not to say that there aren't a few misses on the album. "Born With a Sound," another Bejar track, sounds a lot like a watered-down "War on the East Coast." The following "Wide Eyes" has its moments but largely falls flat, with the band coming across as a New Pornographers cover band.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By contrast, "Dancehall Domine" is the band doing what they do best, and has a classic New Pornographers sound. "Spidyr" is a bit of an oddball, but fits in well with "Hi-Rise," both providing a lush respite from the celebrations. Closer "You Tell Me Where" is a hopeful song, and provides a perfect refrain to end the album.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While &lt;em&gt;Brill Bruisers&lt;/em&gt; never quite reaches the highs of &lt;em&gt;Mass Romantic&lt;/em&gt; or &lt;em&gt;The Electric Version&lt;/em&gt;, it's the best New Pornographers record in a long time, and it's a great album for celebration. It's a triumphant return for a triumphant band.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;of Montreal, part of the &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elephant_Six"&gt;Elephant 6 collective&lt;/a&gt; that spawned (among others) Neutral Milk Hotel and The Olivia Tremor Control, has released twelve albums in sixteen years. While not as consistent in quality as, say, Spoon, of Montreal's substantial output has yielded several magnificent albums. &lt;em&gt;Hissing Fauna, Are You The Destroyer?&lt;/em&gt; is of Montreal's finest work, an impressive struggle with depression and identity backed by infectious melodies and grooves.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This album is a masterpiece. The first half is quintessential quirky indie pop, and the second is glorious glam-pop. The shift is pulled off seamlessly during the album's twelve-minute centerpiece "The Past Is a Grotesque Animal," in which Kevin Barnes (who wrote the album himself) transforms into a black transsexual (&lt;code&gt;I got my Georgie Fruit on / He's a dark mutation / For my demented past time&lt;/code&gt;). He keeps this alter ego for the rest of &lt;em&gt;Hissing Fauna&lt;/em&gt; and of Montreal's next three albums, which are named after the last lines of "Faberge Falls For Shuggie" (&lt;code&gt;Skeletal lamping, the controller sphere, false priest&lt;/code&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The album begins with "Suffer For Fashion," which might be the most straightforwardly catchy song on the album. It has a bit of an early Arcade Fire feel. The next two songs are similarly catchy, trippy indie pop. One of the best tracks on the album is lead single "Heimdalsgate Like a Promethean Curse," a plea with serotonin to not make Barnes "sick again." "Gronlandic Edit" and "A Sentence of Sorts in Kongsvinger" deal with depression, isolation, and identity crisis (&lt;code&gt;I spent the winter with my nose buried in a book / While trying to restructure my character / Cause it had become vile to its creator&lt;/code&gt;). "The Past Is A Grotesque Animal" follows directly after, an epic cathartic freakout. From its ashes rises "Bunny Ain't No Kind Of Rider," a more lighthearted put-down of a club patron's come-on (which he shoots down due to her lack of soul power). "Faberge Falls For Shuggie" is of Montreal at its grooviest and trippiest. "Labrynthian Pomp" is another power-glam tour de force, beginning with &lt;code&gt;How you wanna hate a thing / When you are so inferior&lt;/code&gt;. It flows quite nicely into the similar "She's A Rejector." "We Were Born the Mutants Again With Leafling" is a slightly calmer, more melodic and thoughtful ending to a fantastic album.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Barnes' lyrics contain the key to &lt;em&gt;Hissing Fauna&lt;/em&gt;'s success. &lt;code&gt;We just want to emote until we're dead / I know we suffer for fashion or whatever&lt;/code&gt;, implying that we suffer because it's fashionable. Barnes is notorious for his dry humor, and it's at its strongest here. The album features lines such as &lt;code&gt;Saw her at Go kissing girls, what a shock / I said you must be an artist&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;Somehow you've red-rovered the Gestapo circling my heart&lt;/code&gt; At the same time, he is honest to a fault and inexplicably clever. Throughout the album, Barnes struggles through chemical depression and the deterioration of a relationship, and does so in a brilliant, weird, and yet relatable way. Few songwriters can be as simultaneously odd and familiar as Kevin Barnes, and he is at his best on this album.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Hissing Fauna, Are You The Destroyer?&lt;/em&gt; is an essential listen for anyone who has struggled with chemicals, has a dry wit, or just loves damn good indie pop songs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It took me a few listens to get into &lt;em&gt;You Forgot It In People&lt;/em&gt;. The first time I downloaded it, I skimmed through the songs. Upon not finding any immediate hits on what was billed as a pop album, I decided to give it a more thorough listen on a later date. Now, nearly a year after first listening to it, I decided to give it another chance, and another, and another. There is so much more to this album than I initially thought.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Maybe the most amazing thing about Broken Social Scene is how many incredible bands the supergroup contains. Members of Metric, Feist, and Stars are all present on &lt;em&gt;You Forgot It In People&lt;/em&gt;, and it shows. The band manages to put each individual's talent to good use. This brilliant album is disjointed enough not to be repetitive, but cohesive enough to not lose the listener's attention, even throughout the several instrumentals that are scattered through the track listing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The standout tracks here are definitely fan-favorites "Anthems For A Seventeen Year-Old Girl" and "Lover's Spit." "Anthems" is a stunning piece, consisting of soft banjo plucks and strings drifting around Emily Haines of Metric's looping, warped vocals. The repetition is key as Haines rolls through several choice phrases, letting each resonate before pleading &lt;code&gt;Park that car, drop that phone, sleep on the floor, dream about me&lt;/code&gt; again and again until you want to do just that. The phrase gets gently imprinted in your ears, becoming a sort of mantra which stays in your head through the instrumentals which follow shortly after. "Lover's Spit" is one of the oddest and bitterest ballads in recent memory, and when paired with "Anthems" creates a potent mixture of lonely longing that hasn't been matched in years.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The rest of the album doesn't hit quite as heavily, but when combined with the standout tracks, &lt;em&gt;You Forgot It In People&lt;/em&gt; is easier to relate to than most pop albums. While so much pop is about common problems, it often feels like the musicians are removed and distant. Here, Broken Social Scene is messaging you late at night, because they know exactly how you feel and they want to let you know.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I think what stands out to me the most about &lt;em&gt;You Forgot It In People&lt;/em&gt; is that Broken Social Scene managed to make music for teenagers without being simplistic. The lyrics oscillate between simple, powerful mantras and dark, visceral, abrasive metaphors, but not once does the album come off as condescending or fake. Instead, Broken Social Scene is holding your hair back when you vomit from drinking too much trying to forget, and laughing with you when you laugh at yourself the next morning. You just want to return the favor.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Modern Lovers&lt;/em&gt; starts off with Richman counting &lt;code&gt;1-2-3-4-5-6!&lt;/code&gt;, a twist on the classic four-count that begins so many songs. It's a little familiar, a little odd, and strangely endearing, all threads that run deep in the band's definitive proto-punk opus as well as in the work of the countless artists that were inspired by the album.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="more"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first I heard of The Modern Lovers was James Murphy's name-drop in "Losing My Edge." I've been working my way through all (well, most) of the bands he mentions, and the Modern Lovers Wikipedia page intrigued me, so I got the album. As soon as the first notes hit, I could tell that I was going to witness something unique.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The album begins with "Roadrunner," The Modern Lovers' biggest hit and easily their catchiest song. The groove established on this opening track carries on through the rest of the album, creating a driving force that doesn't pause until "Hospital." A lot has been said about this one already, so I'll just add that it's one of the best road-trip songs ever written. The second track, "Astral Plane," sounds like a missed connection in a hazy basement backed by a trademark Modern Lovers seventies groove--the atmosphere the band manages to create here is palpable. Unfortunately, the rest of the tracks don't stand out as much, especially in comparison to "Roadrunner." However, the band exchanges a lack of standouts for consistency, and the album is so well-executed that the trade off is worthwhile.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One key feature of the album is Jerry Harrison's keyboard. It shows up in all the right places, propelling "Roadrunner," "Pablo Picasso," and "Modern World" but hanging back on the guitar-driven "She Cracked" and "Old World." Bassist Ernie Brooks contributes similarly, displaying the ability to play in several different styles depending on what fits the song best.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This album is definitive proto-punk, but what really sets it apart for me is the heart-on-sleeve nature of the lyrics. When Jonathan Richman rants about Picasso's womanizing ways in the incredibly clever "Pablo Picasso," (which features the refrain &lt;code&gt;Pablo Picasso never got called an asshole&lt;/code&gt;) you get the sense that Richman has been called an asshole too often. Even when Richman cheesily spells out the title of "Girlfriend," he sounds earnest and wide-eyed instead of inane. This is particularly impressive considering the nasal sneer he carries throughout the duration of the album, creating a masterful contrast of punk power and pop vulnerability.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Give &lt;em&gt;The Modern Lovers&lt;/em&gt; a listen. It's a classic collection of strong songs, and there's never a dull moment. It's well worth counting past four for the opportunity to experience the roots of punk taking shape.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Le Tigre is perhaps best known as Kathleen Hanna's other band. Hanna was the frontwoman of Bikini Kill (which kickstarted the riot grrrl movement), has had several documentaries made about her, and (fun-fact) is married to Ad-Rock. But I only heard about Le Tigre yesterday while looking for dance-punk bands. I had no idea Hanna was involved until the first verse of the first (and perhaps best) song, "Deceptacon," which tears down preconceptions, sets expectations, and takes a shot at pop music in five lines: &lt;code&gt;Wanna disco? / Wanna see me disco? / Let me hear you depoliticize my rhyme. / One! Two! Three! Four! /  You got what you been asking for.&lt;/code&gt; It's a classic Hanna takedown, one which sets the tone nicely for the rest of &lt;em&gt;Le Tigre&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="more"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It's this spirit which lies at the heart of the album, and its strengths. Hanna is at her best as a lyricist when she's telling you what's wrong and how it should be. While "Deceptacon" is the standout track of the album, it's closely followed by "Hot Topic," a song about pop music that builds up to a "Losing My Edge"-style list of strong female artists that would take ages to explore. Third track "What's Yr Take On Cassavetes?," in which the band debates the merit of John Cassavetes, is also memorable.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The album never quite regains the dance-punk spark of the first three tracks, but the rest is still an enjoyable listen, especially for those who can't get past Bikini Kill's hardcore influences. Hanna's spirit and message infuse even the weaker tracks with an energy that carries them to greater heights. Whenever the songs begin to feel bland and uninteresting, Hanna manages to pull out a clever lyric or harsh statement that directs the listener's attention front and center once again.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Perhaps &lt;em&gt;Le Tigre&lt;/em&gt;'s greatest trait is its ability to deliver punk spirit entwined with shockingly catchy dance numbers. The album may not be stuffed with conventional dance or punk numbers, but it's a brilliant and vicious strike against oppression and dull pop that will linger in your head for a long time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For the few years I was discovering new music on my own, I would play the most recent album on Rdio to see if I liked a band. In 2011, Spoon's latest was the divisive &lt;em&gt;Transference&lt;/em&gt;. It's still one of my favorite Spoon albums, and I was never a huge fan of &lt;em&gt;GA GA GA GA GA&lt;/em&gt; or &lt;em&gt;Gimme Fiction&lt;/em&gt; (both enjoyable listens, but neither stood out to me). It took me another few years to discover the breakthrough &lt;em&gt;Kill the Moonlight&lt;/em&gt;, which remains my favorite Spoon album. &lt;em&gt;They Want My Soul&lt;/em&gt;, however, is the now-mature band's best offering since their career-standout.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The album begins with first single "Rent I Pay," which sets the tone wonderfully for the rest of the album. It's relatively straightforward but packs the confident groove we've come to expect from Spoon. "Inside Out," a late-night slow-burner (accompanied with a &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IpT5SBg1Mmk"&gt;trippy video&lt;/a&gt;) follows directly after, creating Spoon's strongest one-two punch since 2002's &lt;em&gt;Kill the Moonlight&lt;/em&gt; ("Small Stakes"/"The Way We Get By"). The acoustic guitar/bass/drum combination on the next three tracks prove that Spoon haven't lost the ability to groove, which was front-and-center on &lt;em&gt;GA GA GA GA GA&lt;/em&gt;, even managing to surpass some of the album's finest tracks. "Do You,"" in particular, sounds like an improved version of "Don't You Evah."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The second half of the album is where Spoon shakes things up a bit. "Outlier" sounds like Arctic Monkeys' "Fireside" with better lyrical themes and more well-placed digs at Garden State (&lt;code&gt;I remember you walked out of Garden State / You had taste, you had taste, you had taste&lt;/code&gt;). The title track stands out as one of the most "daytime"-sounding tracks an album that sounds most comfortable playing through car speakers late at night. "I Just Don't Understand" is a great cover that ties in nicely to "Let Me Be Mine"; the latter is some of Britt Daniel's better plainspoken, more emotional writing. "New York Kiss" completes the sentimental trilogy, ending on a note worthy of the rest of the album.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Admittedly, much of the instrumentation doesn't stand out, but this is no surprise. Spoon are remarkably consistent. True to form, the way the band combines all their tight, crisp, relatively simple pieces together remains their greatest strength. Some tracks sound quite similar, but repeated listens reveal intricacies that make each track stand out in its own way.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Overall, &lt;em&gt;They Want My Soul&lt;/em&gt; is one of the year's best releases so far, providing exciting, intriguing variations on the classic Spoon sound. Do yourself a favor and listen to it.&lt;/p&gt;
