            <pre><code>Artist: Hundred Waters  
Song: Murmurs  
Album: The Moon Rang Like A Bell  
Label: OWSLA  
</code></pre>

<p>From one of the most intimate and subtlety enchanting albums of the year comes “Murmurs,” in my opinion, the standout track from <em>The Moon Rang Like A Bell</em>. In yet another song that catapults you into the cosmos, Hundred Waters’ Nicole Miglis immerses you in her realities, setting you on the journey that is the whole record itself. Besides the piano, which guides you into Miglis’ <code>I wish you could see what I see</code>, all these colliding sounds are so new, as are all these softly intimate layers to the vocals. The song is almost like entering a void of crashing comets and soaring planets, but all the while remaining so very December cold and bright. Skrillex signed Hundred Waters to his label with only one LP under their belt, on which they have expanded to their limits, filling in their reputation as the most willowy, whispery indie group of the year, and “Murmurs” is no exception. It is breathed into your ears, enters your soul, and like the video for the track so expertly depicts, almost prepares and repairs your being for a Winter season full of joy and sorrow; an embrace so close that you can feel the click of the tongue on the last <code>Silly silly silly me // I used to use to see // Now our holy holy light // Is blowing out</code>. This almost Christmas-like hymn is that holy, holy light in the darkness of the chill. </p>

<pre><code>Artist: The Flavr Blue  
Song: No Remedy  
Album: Bright Vices  
</code></pre>

<p>I’m a big supporter of fellow Seattle local Hollis Wong-Wear, co-writer of Macklemore’s White Walls and The Flavr Blue lead, so I might be a bit biased in choosing this for a track to listen to during the holiday season, that is, if you’re like me and you’d rather do anything than socialize. My winter self is especially bitter and somber, and screw you, I’m not depressed (Yeah, Dad)! I first heard The Flavr Blue’s FXF, which was the soundtrack to which me and a friend as we ended up lost in south Seattle and angry as hell at each other (long story), but 2013’s <em>Bright Vices</em> strays away from their debut <em>Pisces</em>’ reckless party fight anthems, and leads more to the route of rowdy synth-pop. Add the blend of Hollis’ lovely, twinkling champagne vocals that contrast the defiant chorus of <code>there's no remedy for the ways that i've changed // so i've nothing to lose walking into the flame</code>, to floating, trance-like hooks and this song feels like a blustery, starry night. The entirety of the futuristic <em>Bright Vices</em> is like being trapped in a cold, and beautiful space castle, but relatable enough that I used to sing along to these all these tracks in high school. </p>

<pre><code>Artist: Eskmo  
Song: Cloudlight  
Album: Eskmo  
Label: Ninja Tune  
</code></pre>

<p>Brendan ‘Eskmo’ Angelides’ “Cloudlight” is more of a compilation of sounds than a song. It still fits with our chilly and aerial theme, although Angelides’ Moby-esque vocals, sparse, low and groveling, add to the moody and black depths of the track. The beats shuffle and whirl by the traveling listener, “floating and floating and floating in light” on a tour of the dark heavens, and it almost makes you dizzy. Lyrics are least important in this song; it’s more about the feelings of Angelides’ voice. The rough rawness of his tone pushes forward the zooms and zips of the infrequent synths. Listen to the rest of the album, and the sentiments continue forward hard-pressed, and grittier than ever. “Anger” is the word that comes to mind with “Got More,” the second track on Eskmo, maybe even “frustration”, but a frustration created with such intrigue and harsh, emphasized beats, accented by the sparsity of the vocals which are only necessary to give focus to the music. I won’t deny that “Cloudlight" lacks the holiday spirituality of “Murmurs,” but what it lacks in beauty, it makes up for in a deep and wintery enigma, punctuated by a reflectiveness that is most characteristic of late December, and waiting for the pending year to unfold.</p>

<pre><code>Artist: Wye Oak  
Song: Civilian  
Album: Civilian  
Label: Merge  
</code></pre>

<p>Saving the most humbled and grounded tunes for last, here is “Civilian,” by 21st-Century folk-rock duo Wye Oak. This song was featured in the 2012 film Safety Not Guaranteed, and as the characters booze their way through bumper cars and ferris wheels and go-karts, I fell in love with the sweet crescendos of Jenn Wasner’s lamentation on emotional weights coming crashing down upon an innocent bystander. Here we descend from our lofty, spacey anthems and enter earthly realities with a shock like a cold and crystal knife piercing the starry skies we’ve established with the previous floating and fanciful tracks. “Civilian”: partners become strangers; witnesses to a relationship overtaken by painful, heavy histories, the most honest of the narratives on our playlist. And now comes the explosive solo, reminiscent of Neil Young who leaves you sad and wanting to take a ride on a dark highway leading West. “Civilian” is chilly as it is arresting and pure.</p>

<p>Here’s to a cheerful winter season to soothe the cold and sad of heart. </p>
